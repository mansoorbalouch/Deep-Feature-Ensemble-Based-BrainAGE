![Project Image](path/to/your/project/image.png) <!-- If you have a project image, include it here -->

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an ensemble-based deep feature extraction method for training a brain age estimation model. The model predicts the brain age based on raw voxel features or 3D volumes of brain MRIs. The project involves fusing the results of 4 state-of-the-art deep learning-based brain age estimation models. The proposed framework demonstrates improved performance compared to individual brain age estimation models. The implementation is done using both TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Features

- Brain age estimation using raw voxel features or 3D volumes of brain MRIs.
- Fusion of results from 4 state-of-the-art deep learning-based models.
- Improved performance through ensemble-based approach.
- Implementation using both TensorFlow and PyTorch.
